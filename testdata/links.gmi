# Links

gmnhg supports links, images, and footnotes. These are extracted from paragraphs and other block elements recursively.

As there's no inline links in Gemtext, gmnhg instead renders links blocks after paragraphs. Links blocks are sorted by type: first footnotes, then images, then links, blocks of a distinct type separated by a single newline.

## Inline links & images

For inline Markdown links, the text inside the square brackets is used as link title: for instance, the link to Gemini specification along with a link to the current CommonMark spec will generate a block of two links.

=> https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi Gemini specification
=> https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/ CommonMark spec

gomarkdown works with reference-style links as well. Unused reference links are ignored.

=> https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown gomarkdown

xkcd #1853 serves quite well as an inline image example.

=> https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/once_per_day.png xkcd #1853

Other container elements can contain inline links as well. For instance, this is an example of a link inside a blockquote:

> OTR has significant usability drawbacks for inter-client mobility.
> â€” XEP-0384

=> https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html XEP-0384

Links will get encoded according to RFC 3986, like this sample link to nowhere. The other sample link to somewhere on GitHub will not get transformed: sample.

=> /URI%20with%20spaces link
=> https://github.com:443/request+with+characters%20 sample

## Footnotes

gmnhg supports footnotes, written like this[^1]. Footnotes can use any references, including alphanumeric ones[^2]; alphanumeric references will be replaced with numeric IDs on render.

[^1]: Footnotes can only consist of a single source line due to a quirk of gomarkdown.
[^2]: Footnotes can contain any kind of inline **formatting** paragraphs do. For instance, this is a link to GitHub.

=> https://github.com GitHub

This line looks like it would belong to footnote 1, but it actually doesn't, and is therefore treated as a new paragraph.

## Lists of links

gmnhg additionally supports a special kind of lists: lists consisting solely of links. For these, content rendering will be skipped entirely, and a links block will be rendered instead.

### Markdown lists

Links-only lists can be of any type, but they can only be of level 1. The two lists below will get rendered as links blocks:

=> https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi Gemini specification
=> https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg gmnhg

=> https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/best-practices.gmi Best practices for Gemini implementers
=> https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.gmi Project Gemini FAQ

The list below contains other meaningful text in its items, and will get rendered as a regular list:

* Gemini specification is a must-read for a Gemini developer.

=> https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi Gemini specification

### Series of links

A series of inline links in a single paragraph, if the paragraph contains no extra meaningful symbols (aside from spaces and newlines), will also get rendered as a single links block:

=> https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg gmnhg
=> https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi Gemini specification

This also works for single-link paragraphs:

=> https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi Gemini specification
